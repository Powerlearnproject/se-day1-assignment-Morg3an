#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

**Software engineering** is a systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software.It applies engineering principles to software creation, ensuring efficiency, reliability, and scalability. This field encompasses methodologies, tools, and best practices for designing, building, testing, and managing software systems.

**Importance of Software Engineering in the Technology Industry**
1. Ensures High-Quality Software – Software engineering helps create robust, secure, and efficient software that meets user and business needs.
2. Enhances Productivity – Well-structured development processes streamline work, reducing time and effort.
3. Improves Maintainability – Engineering principles enable easy updates, bug fixes, and feature enhancements.
4. Reduces Costs and Risks – Proper planning, testing, and documentation minimize development costs and mitigate risks.
5. Facilitates Scalability – Software engineering practices allow applications to grow and handle increasing workloads efficiently.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. **The 1968 NATO Conference on Software Engineering**
The term "software engineering" was officially introduced to address the "software crisis" caused by increasing project failures, cost overruns, and unreliable software.
This milestone marked the beginning of structured approaches to software development.
Introduction of the Waterfall Model (1970s)

2. **Winston W. Royce** introduced the **Waterfall Model**, a structured software development process with sequential phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation, testing, maintenance).
This model became the foundation for software development methodologies.
Rise of Agile Development (2001)

3. **The Agile Manifesto** introduced iterative, flexible, and customer-focused software development approaches.
Agile methods, such as Scrum and Kanban, emphasized collaboration, rapid delivery, and continuous improvement.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Requirement Analysis – Gathering and defining software requirements from stakeholders.
2. Planning – Defining project scope, timeline, budget, and resource allocation.
3. Design – Creating architectural blueprints, data models, and system design specifications.
4. Implementation (Coding) – Writing and developing the software based on design specifications.
5. Testing – Identifying and fixing bugs through unit, integration, and system testing.
6. Deployment – Releasing the software for end-users or customers.
7. Maintenance and Support – Updating, improving, and fixing issues post-deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
**Waterfall Methodology** vs **Agile Methodology**
1. The Waterfall methododlogy is sequential and structured while the agile methodology is iterative and flexible.
2. The phases in the waterfall methodology are defined upfront, i.e. phases do not overlap while in the agile methodology phases are continuous, with frequent iterations.
3. Difficult and costly to implement changes in the waterfall methodolgy whereas changes can be incorporated at any stage in the agile methodology.
4. In the waterfall methodolgy the feedback is received after the product is completed while agile methodology allows steady, ongoing feedback from stakeholders.
5. In waterfall methodology the development is heavily documented before the actual development starts, while in agile methodology there is minimal documentation, more focus on working software.
6. In waterfall methodology, testing is performed at the end of development, while in agile methodology there is continuous testing throughout the development cycle.

**Example Scenarios**
- **Waterfall**: A healthcare records management system where strict regulatory compliance is required and changes after deployment are costly.
- **Agile**: A social media app startup where user preferences and business goals evolve, requiring frequent updates and iterative improvements.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

1. **Software Developer**
- Writes and maintains code following best practices.
- Collaborates with designers, QA engineers, and project managers.
- Optimizes application performance and security.
- Debugs and fixes software issues.
2. **Quality Assurance Engineer**
- Designs and executes test plans, including unit, integration, and system testing.
- Identifies and reports bugs to developers.
- Ensures software reliability and compliance with specifications.
- Automates testing to improve efficiency.
3. **Project Manager**
- Oversees project progress and ensures it stays on schedule.
- Manages resources and team coordination.
- Communicates with stakeholders and gathers requirements.
- Mitigates risks and resolves project roadblocks.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

**Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)**
1. Code Efficiency – Features like auto-completion, syntax highlighting, and debugging tools speed up development.
2. Error Detection – Built-in debugging and linting tools help catch errors early.
3. Project Management – Many IDEs provide file navigation, refactoring tools, and build automation.
4. Seamless Integration – Support for plugins, frameworks, and version control enhances development workflows.

**Examples of IDEs:**
- Visual Studio Code
- IntelliJ IDEA
- PyCharm

**Version Control Systems (VCS)**
1. Collaboration – Multiple developers can work on the same project without conflicts.
2. Change Tracking – Maintains a history of code modifications, making debugging easier.
3. Branching and Merging – Enables feature development in separate branches before merging into the main codebase.
4. Backup and Recovery – Ensures that code is not lost due to errors or system failures.

**Examples of VCS:**
- Git – A distributed VCS used with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.
- Subversion (SVN) – A centralized VCS used in enterprise applications.
- Mercurial – Known for scalability and speed in managing large projects.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

**Prompt engineering** is the process of crafting well-structured inputs (prompts) to optimize responses from AI models. It involves refining queries to achieve accurate, relevant, and meaningful outputs.

**Importance of Prompt Engineering in AI Model Interaction:**
1. Enhances Response Quality – Well-structured prompts lead to precise and useful AI-generated outputs.
2. Improves Efficiency – Reduces the need for multiple iterations by getting the desired response on the first attempt.
3. Enables AI Customization – Tailoring prompts helps align AI responses with specific contexts and requirements.
4. Reduces Ambiguity – Clear prompts minimize vague or incorrect AI-generated results.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

**Vague Prompt:** *"Tell me about technology."*

**Problems with the prompt:**
- Too broad – "Technology" covers many fields, e.g., AI, robotics, software development.
- Lacks focus – Does the user want history, trends, applications, or challenges?
- Unclear depth – No indication of whether a summary or detailed analysis is needed.

**Improved Prompt:** *"Provide a brief overview of recent advancements in AI, focusing on deep learning and natural language processing."*

**Why it's more effective?**
- Specific Topic – Narrowed down to "AI advancements."
- Defined Scope – Focuses on "deep learning" and "natural language processing."
- Clarity in Depth – Requests a "brief overview" rather than an exhaustive analysis.
